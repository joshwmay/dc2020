    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the summer in 2019, DOTS installed Numina 
      sensors at 5 intersections on campus to count bikes, pedestrians, cars, buses, trucks, and identify path of travel.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goals outlined for us to explore were outlined 
      as follows:
    <li>Summarize (visualize) the time trend for traffic by each mode. What is the temporal dynamic of traffic at
       each location?
    </li>
    <li>Explain the dynamic you observe: What factors may affect the traffic on campus? We think it’s worth exploring the 
      impact of weather conditions, class schedules, noticeable events on campus (e.g. Game Day), and other factors that 
      may cause traffic to fluctuate.</li>
    <li>After the initial explorations, you can choose either one of the following three topics to continue developing your story:</li>
      <ol> > As part of the Campus Climate Plan, DOTS aims to reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles. Using data analysis and 
        visualization, come up with a few ideas to improve transportation planning and traffic management on campus</ol>
      <ol> > Build a traffic count predictive model using data science techniques and explain the usefulness of your model.</ol>
      <ol> > Use traffic and count data to measure the campus’ social, economic, and health benefits to walking, biking, and taking transit.</ol>
