This repository contains work completed over the course of one week in analyzing a specific dataset
related to traffic on the University of Maryland campus in College Par, MD. 

Our aim was to address the problem set as articulately as possible and form a better understanding
of where the numbers could tell a story. The end goal being to present our story in the form of a website, 
enabling attendees to access our work from their own devices. There was special attention applied to
ensure our website would be ADA compliant also; and Tableau allowed our visualizations to be published
in their public domain. The whole experience could be compared to an agile push with an organization.
We were able to produce a deliverable that is worthy of note, because it is something that can be built upon.
The skills we worked with involved blended analysis, design, powerful applications, and an attempt at
visual storytelling through website.

We printed QR codes to our site for others to access. For those who got our demo, we guided them through the site,
and informed them they could do more with each visual by clicking on their images; where they could go back and interact 
with the Tableau visuals we generated.

Our group was able to complement one another well, and were able to put together a story over the course of a week.
Much effort went into building a platform for the work. The styling of the website took some 
time to refine, as we tested different methods of sharing data visualizations that were completed separately. 
This proved too difficult to complete within the timeframe of the competition so we opted for a simpler method
to properly stylize visuals using screenshots linked to Tableau workbooks.

The resulting website can be seen at http://dc20045.herokuapp.com/ 

Our group was able to win the Outstanding Undergraduate award in the end.

This was made possible to the work we have each done at the University of Maryland learning from tremendous
personnel in the iSchool.

Thank you to the team at DOTS that allowed us to work with such an interesting dataset and attempt a curious question.

Personal thanks are in order to the following:
Professor Alex Leitch who taught this group about web dynamics; a feature that allowed our work to be tangible. 
Professor Eric Newburger, who was teaching two members from this group about data visualizations during the 
project period semester. 
Dr. Elizabeth Bonsignore, for being a great mentor and conduit to studying information science.
Thank you to all the other individuals involved with our information studies.
Thanks to the volunteers that helped facilitate things before and during the week of competition.
Special thanks finally, to Tammie Nelson and Dr. Kathy Weaver for putting together such a great event.
